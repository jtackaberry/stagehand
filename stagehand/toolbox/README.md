This "toolbox" module is a port of the most useful modules from
[kaa.base](https://github.com/freevo/kaa-base) to Python 3.Where applicable,
all asynchronous code has been adapted from kaa.base's native async API to
Python 3.4's [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) module
(aka Tulip).
